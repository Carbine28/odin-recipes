        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine brown sugar, white sugar, and salt into a large bowl.Beat with an electric mixer until creamy
                    , deep brown mixture forms. Add egg and vaille, beat until mixture lightens and becomes smooth.
                </li>
                <li>Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Add slowly to the wet ingredients until mostly incorporated,
                    but some white traces of flour remain. Fold in milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and white chocolate using a spatula, not the mixer.
                    Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C when ready to bake.</li>
                <li>Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce portions and place on a cookie sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to look golden brown and crispy,
                    10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake; the centers will not look fully done. Cool until cookies are set, about 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
